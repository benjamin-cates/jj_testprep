            "An extensive family found under almost every rock are some of the most <b>ubiquitous</b> of insects—ants. Two thousand different species inhabit every part of the Earth except the polar regions. None demonstrates the ability to adapt to harsh environments better than the Black Desert Ant of North Africa.",
            "This small ant, an apparently <b>ingenious</b> creature, lives in underground burrows. It emerges only when it goes searching for food, which is its main form of <b>sustenance</b>. The desert it has to <b>traverse</b> can extend for several hundred yards. Because it has no way of knowing where food might be found, the ant follows a <b>haphazard</b> walk with frequent changes of direction. Its task, <b>fraught</b> with danger, is to survive in the <b>torrid</b> North African desert, where temperatures can climb to 60°C when the sun reaches its <b>zenith</b>. In such heat, the ant’s life depends on the speed with which it can accomplish its goal. The Black Desert Ant has <b>lagged</b> behind in few races in its evolutionary history. That’s an achievement considering that its legs are a fraction of an inch long!",
            "Having located a dead insect, the ant must return quickly to its burrow. This is no easy task for the ant, <b>encumbered</b> with a burden which may weigh more than it does. There is no time for the ant to wonder which direction it should go. Nor does it ask! What is remarkable about the black desert ant, and the reason it has aroused the interest of scientists, is its ability to return to its burrow directly following the shortest possible route.",
            "The desert’s surface is quite featureless. So how does the ant know in which direction to go after it captures its prey? By studying the ant’s brain and observing its behavior, entomologists—scientists who study insects—were able to deduce the answer to this question. They concluded that the ant’s brain must store information about every change of direction, as well as the distances traveled.",
            "Scientists found that the eyes of the black desert ant provide its brain with crucial information. Unlike human eyes, which have only a single lens, the eyes of the black desert ant contain an <b>array</b> of eighty lenses. These multiple lenses change the nature of the light passing through them, causing the light to become polarized. Polarized light vibrates in a single plane instead of scattering and vibrating in many planes at once, as is the case with light passing through a human eye. The polarized light is different for each area of the sky, so that every change in the ant’s path alters the pattern of polarized light registered by the ant’s brain. Should the ant turn, say, thirty degrees to the left, the changed pattern is recorded and stored in the ant’s memory. This pattern then shows the ant its location relative to its burrow, thus enabling the ant to return there directly.",
            "Scientists next tackled the seemingly <b>inexplicable</b> mystery of how the ant measures distance. A surprisingly simple experiment yielded the answer. They set up a narrow track along which the ant had to travel from its burrow. After going thirty feet in a single direction, the ant found a dead insect obligingly placed there by the scientists. The ant now wished to retrace its steps and return to its burrow; but instead, the scientists forced it to go back along a parallel track much longer than the first. After going thirty feet, the ant stopped and began searching for its burrow. To the scientists, this provided <b>incontrovertible</b> proof that the ant measures the distance it has traveled by “counting” its footsteps.",
            "Not all ants have to cope with the hostile environment of the North African desert, but each species of ant is amazing in its own way and has developed its own strategy for survival. Considering what they have learned about insects such as ants, it’s no wonder that many zoologists find entomology fascinating."
