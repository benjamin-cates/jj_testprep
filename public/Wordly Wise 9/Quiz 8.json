            "My little brother Javier can be hard to handle when he has to be quiet or keep still. We were at a classical-music concert when a six-year-old violin <b>prodigy</b> was introduced. As he started playing, Javier stood up, pointed at him, and said loudly, “He’s the same age as me!” The audience laughed, but it was such bad timing! I was so embarrassed. Meanwhile, Mami gave him her <b>tacit</b> approval by smiling as she shushed him.",
            "The whole situation reminded me of my National Honor Society <b>induction</b> ceremony, when Javier had yelled, “THAT’S MY SISTER!” just as I was welcomed into the society by accepting a gold pin from my school’s principal. Javier just doesn’t understand that being <b>raucous</b> at formal events isn’t acceptable.",
            "If he doesn’t learn soon when to keep quiet, I am not sure what I will do. Mami says he’s only six and will learn how to control himself better when he gets older. I hope so, because I don’t want to be at my high school or college graduation ceremony and have him <b>lapse</b> into behavior that makes me cringe and turn red with embarrassment."
