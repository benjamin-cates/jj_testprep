          "passage": [
            "By order of the government, the country went into three days of mourning. All schools and official buildings were closed. Flags were lowered to half-mast. Was the nation <b>lamenting</b> the passing of a president or a famous general? No. The person whose death was being marked with such <b>pomp</b> was a poet. The country was Chile, the year was 1957, and the poet was Gabriela Mistral, born Lucila Godoy Alcayaga.",
            "Lucila grew up in Chile’s Valley of Elqui, a place she <b>alluded</b> to frequently in her poems as an earthly paradise of vineyards, fig orchards, and green hills. Her father <b>doted</b> on his child, making a garden for Lucila and listening with delight as she talked about bees, birds, and insects. But his <b>feckless</b> ways and frequent absences caused quarrels between Lucila’s parents. When the little girl was three, her father disappeared from her life forever. Friends remembered her as a solitary child whose <b>pensive</b> ways set her off from companionship. She compensated for this by creating a rich interior world for herself. By the age of eleven, she was writing her first poems.",
            "When she was a young woman, unhappy love affairs brought <b>trauma</b> to Lucila’s life. In one particularly hard incident, the young man committed suicide after being <b>implicated</b> in a crime. Believing that marriage and motherhood were not in her future, she <b>consecrated</b> her life to teaching, a calling she held in the highest regard, and writing poetry. Taking the pen name Gabriela Mistral, she poured her grief into her poetry: “I spoke of this destiny, of mine—A mortar of blood and tears. After this I know there can be nothing more.”",
            "Hers was a fresh voice, sometimes direct, even harsh; other times it was tender and wistful, offering quite a contrast to the often <b>stilted</b> language of some of her contemporaries. In 1922, Mistral received international recognition with the publication of Desolación [Desolation]. This was a volume of poetry pervaded by a sense of suffering and lost love, and with scorn for indifference to pain and excessive emphasis on materialism. Mistral used her newfound celebrity to <b>disseminate</b> her views on education, which began appearing in newspapers and journals throughout the Americas. She was invited to visit Mexico to advise leaders there on educational reform, and the Chilean government appointed her “consul for life.” The salary she received from her official position enabled her to pursue her literary and educational activities free from <b>monetary</b> worries.",
            "Whatever her activity, concern for children, nature, and the downtrodden filled her mind. Her second book, Ternura [Tenderness], contains many children’s songs and verses that reflect her study of folk verse, nursery rhymes, and lullabies. Next came Tala [Devastation], a reference to the <b>wanton</b> destruction of Chile’s forests by greedy timber barons. She assigned the proceeds from Tala to the relief of children orphaned by the Spanish Civil War, after <b>exhortations</b> to the countries of South America to take in refugees from Spain went unheeded. In 1945, Gabriela Mistral was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. She was the first Latina writer to be so honored. In her acceptance speech, she expressed her thanks on behalf of the people of “the southern hemisphere of the American continent.”",
            "Now a world figure, Mistral traveled extensively in Europe and throughout the Americas. She taught, wrote, and spoke out in public on behalf of the world’s children who were denied education and forced to work in appalling conditions for low wages. Unhappy about the <b>subjugation</b> of women in much of the world, she served on the United Nations committee on the status of women. At the same time, she expressed “highest admiration” for the achievements of women in the United States and lived there for a time. She was staying with friends on Long Island when she died on January 10, 1957, at age 67.",
            "In Santiago, Gabriela Mistral's funeral was attended by hundreds of thousands of people, including many children, which was appropriate for a woman whose heart had adopted the children of the whole world and who had celebrated them in her poetry: \"Rivers are circles of children/Running off to the sea as they play/Waves are circlets of little girls/Embracing this world...as they play..."
