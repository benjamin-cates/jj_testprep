            "Diana, Princess of Wales, died on August 31, 1997, as the result of a <b>traumatic</b> car accident. Her public life as a princess was filled with grandeur, <b>pomp</b>, and ceremony, but her private life was known to be troubled. Following her divorce from Prince Charles, she remained beloved by the British people and had millions of fans and followers worldwide. She had a significant impact on the world of fashion and in popular culture that extended beyond her role as a member of royalty. On the day of her funeral, thousands of people lined the streets <b>lamenting</b> her sudden death, at age thirty-six, with an incredible outpouring of sorrow. Although tabloid newspapers <b>alluded</b> to murder as the reason for her death, it was discovered later that it was nothing but a tragic accident, rather than a <b>wanton</b> act of violence."
