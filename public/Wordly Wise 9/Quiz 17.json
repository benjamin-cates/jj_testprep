            "There are many things that make an old-fashioned county fair unique. While many have the same rides as amusement parks do, they tend to charge less for entry and also have some charming traditions that make attending one a fun and worthwhile experience.",
            "One tradition is the contests. For example, farmers grow “monster” pumpkins and zucchini squash and then pay a <b>nominal</b> fee just to enter a contest to see who grew the biggest and best. Contest judges carefully check for <b>blight</b> with magnifying glasses and measure and weigh each giant gourd as the eager crowd watches. Usually everyone agrees on the winner of these contests, but the pie and baking competitions are different. These can be seen as a <b>farce</b> because the same people often win year after year. Lastly, many fairs feature a different kind of “contest”: reenactments of historical military battles, in which people dressed as soldiers pretend to make <b>forays</b> into “enemy territory.”",
            "One of the oldest county fairs, held annually in Fryeburg, Maine, includes night performances by entertainers. All performers make sure their shows are family-friendly. For example, comedians try not to tell <b>ribald</b> jokes or use language that would not be appropriate for children. Thus, this county fair—like all others—remains a great way for families to have fun together."
