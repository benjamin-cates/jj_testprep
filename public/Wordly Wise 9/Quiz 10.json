            "Unfortunately, for many U.S. athletes, the most difficult obstacle in the path to victory at the Olympics isn’t skill, effort, or talent—it’s their <b>incapacity</b> to raise the funds needed to continue full-time training. Athletes who are able to successfully <b>solicit</b> funding for their athletic careers from <b>magnanimous</b> donors have their basic costs covered, but these athletes are rarely wealthy. After all, Olympians aren’t <b>remunerated</b> for the hours they spend training. Only the most famous U.S. Olympic athletes are sponsored by companies and therefore paid the way we might expect, given their talent and status."
