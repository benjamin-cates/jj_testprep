            "The <b>raucous</b> boxing fans, gathered at Madison Square Garden in New York on February 6, 1993, <b>lapsed</b> into silence as the announcement came over the public address system. Tennis champion Arthur Ashe had just died of pneumonia. With their response, the crowd paid their respects to a man whose presence had been felt far beyond the world of tennis. His death, though shocking, was not entirely unexpected. A year earlier, knowing that newspapers were about to reveal the fact that he was suffering from AIDS, Ashe called a news conference to announce that he had contracted the disease from infected blood he had received during heart bypass surgery in 1983.",
            "Arthur Ashe was born in Richmond, Virginia, in 1943. When he was six, his mother died. His father, a parks policeman, was left to raise their two sons alone in a society where the races were legally segregated. Because of his father’s occupation, Ashe was allowed on the whites-only city tennis courts. He began playing on these courts at the age of seven and demonstrated a natural ability for the game. At the age of ten, he met Dr. Walter Johnson, an African American physician whose <b>avocation</b> was assisting young African American tennis players. “Dr. J.” recognized the young boy as a tennis <b>prodigy</b> and took him under his wing. The doctor arranged for his <b>protégé</b> to attend tennis camps and to take part in competitions.",
            "In 1955, when Ashe was thirteen, he tried to enter a tournament in his hometown of Richmond. He was rejected because of his race. This and other such <b>affronts</b> to his dignity led ultimately to his <b>crusade</b> to change the image of tennis as a white, middle-class game. His accomplishments in this area include starting tennis programs in five major cities and helping found the National Junior Tennis League. These acts were designed to open up the game to inner-city youth.",
            "Ashe’s calm <b>demeanor</b> on the tennis court earned him the respect of spectators everywhere. It was a <b>tacit</b> rebuke to his opponents, who often went out of their way to attract attention by hurling their rackets to the ground and engaging in other tantrums. However, Ashe’s placid manner never fooled anyone into thinking that he lacked fire. He intimidated his opponents with the ferocity of his play; his smashing serve and <b>adroit</b> placing of the ball (he developed sixteen variations of his backhand alone) were especially feared.",
            "In 1968, Ashe won the U.S. Open and was ranked number one by the United States Lawn Tennis Association. Two years later he won the Australian Open. In 1975, he reached what many consider the summit of tennis achievement by winning the men’s singles title at Wimbledon. In 1980, he retired from active playing because of a heart condition, which indirectly caused his premature death. For the next five years, he captained the United States Davis Cup Team, and in 1985 he was <b>inducted</b> into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.",
            "In his retirement, Ashe wanted to be more than a celebrity. He served as national chairman of the American Heart Association and also raised funds for AIDS research. He proved himself to be a graceful and <b>erudite</b> writer. His major work, <i>A Hard Road to Glory: A History of the African-American Athlete</i>, published in 1988, is recognized as the <b>definitive</b> work on the subject.",
            "In his memoir <i>Days of Grace</i>, published in 1993, Ashe says, “While blood was pouring in the streets of Birmingham, Memphis, and Biloxi...dressed in immaculate whites, I was elegantly stroking tennis balls in perfectly paved courts in California, New York, and Europe.” As if to make up for his earlier detachment from the Civil Rights Movement, Ashe became increasingly <b>militant</b> in his later years. He marched in protests against South Africa’s apartheid system. He protested the policy of the United States against Haitian refugees. On these and other occasions, he was arrested. Although in his memoir he writes, “I am with Thoreau, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King in their belief that violence achieves nothing but the destruction of the individual soul and the corruption of the state,” he also expresses regret that he did not see things differently earlier in life.",
            "The state of Virginia, which had treated him and so many others of his race as <b>pariahs</b>, honored Ashe in his death. His body lay in state in Virginia’s capitol in Richmond as the world mourned."
