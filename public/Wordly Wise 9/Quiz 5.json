            "Ideas about how older people should be treated, and what their characteristics are, vary depending on culture. In many cultures, the elderly are seen as <b>sagacious</b> due to a lifetime of experience and are worthy of the utmost respect. It is taken for granted that adult children will take care of their parents once the parents become elderly, regarding such care as an honor and privilege. Those who don’t do this are seen as lazy and <b>indolent</b>.",
            "In other cultures, however, it is more common for the elderly to live alone or to spend their last days in a nursing home and to be seen as mentally fragile. Some take an even more <b>cynical</b> view, believing that the elderly are purposely irritating and intrude too often in younger people’s lives. They doubt older people's intentions when they offer advice.",
            "If you grew up thinking that older people don't have something to offer, it's important to question this attitude. It is <b>callow</b> and foolish to assume that you know more than someone who is older than you. Those with a <b>voracious</b> desire to learn should consider how much wisdom the elderly can share."
