They are the work of the remarkable American sculptor and dramatic personality Gutzon Borglum.",
            "Born in Idaho in 1867, Borglum led an artist’s <b>vagabond</b> life in America and Europe for twenty years before settling in New York City in 1901. There, he soon achieved an international reputation as a sculptor. The idea that “Small is beautiful” would not have applied to Borglum; his view was that “Bigger is better.”",
            "The <b>impetus</b> for the Mount Rushmore project came in 1926 when the state historian of South Dakota, knowing Borglum’s views, invited him to create a monumental work of art for the Black Hills mountain region. Borglum accepted the challenge immediately, but the project he proposed did not meet with universal approval. Many felt that the carvings would <b>detract</b> from the area’s natural beauty. Cora Johnson, a South Dakota journalist, expressed such feelings when she wrote: “Man makes statues, but God made the mountains. Leave them alone.” Borglum, however, was not one to heed this advice.",
            "The question of which national figures to honor caused much debate. Sioux Chief Red Cloud, who had fought against white encroachment on Native American lands, was one of the names proposed. Another was Susan B. Anthony, who had <b>bewailed</b> nineteenth-century women’s lack of the right to vote in political elections, and led the struggle to <b>emancipate</b> them from this deprivation. The final decision, however, was left to Borglum. Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln were obvious choices, but Borglum had a personal reason for his fourth selection, a man of enormous energy who <b>extolled</b> physical fitness and vigorous activity. In his own life, Borglum strove to emulate his hero, so Theodore Roosevelt became the fourth figure honored at Mount Rushmore.",
            "Money to pay for the project was a problem from the beginning, and work proceeded <b>intermittently</b>, especially after 1930, when the country was in the grip of the Great Depression. During those years, Borglum made frequent visits to the nation’s capital seeking financial assistance. Loath to stoop to <b>wheedling</b>, the sculptor managed to convince a reluctant Congress to provide funding to go on with the project. Nor was lack of funds the only problem Borglum had to grapple with. Because of the hard granite rock, the difficulties of carving out the faces had at first seemed <b>insuperable</b>, but Borglum solved the problem by exploding small charges of dynamite to remove pieces of rock. Under his supervision, workers in harnesses suspended from the mountaintop drilled, chipped, and chiseled away at the rock. So skillful was Borglum that his eye for precise measurement enabled him to tell if a line was <b>plumb</b> to a quarter of an inch.",
            "During his lifetime, Borglum had earned enormous sums from the sale of his works. However, he did not embrace Benjamin Franklin’s <b>maxim</b> “A penny saved is a penny earned.” Instead, he lived a <b>flamboyant</b> lifestyle. His daughter, Mary Ellis, recalls: “He loved flashy cars and hired chauffeurs to drive them.” So careless was he about money that he died <b>destitute</b> on March 6, 1941, before he’d finished Mount Rushmore. It was left to his son Lincoln, who had assisted him throughout, to complete the project eight months later."
