            "Working with attorneys, judicial interpreters help individuals understand what is happening when they must stand before the judge to plead guilty or not guilty to a crime. They must convey not just the meaning of the words spoken, but the tone as well—for example, when the tone from a sarcastic judge is <b>vitriolic</b>.",
            "Judicial interpreters are always learning. Sometimes they are sent materials to study so they can become familiar with specific technical words and phrases related to the evidence in a trial. An interpreter working on a case in which someone is <b>indicted</b> for setting a fire might have to learn the names of chemicals used for <b>incineration</b>. Or, if a case involves a religious group, the interpreter may need to learn about beliefs, practices, and important religious figures such as <b>martyrs</b>."
