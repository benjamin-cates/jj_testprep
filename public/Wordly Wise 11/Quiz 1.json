She was very confident in those situations. But for some reason even the thought of speaking up in class made her start <b>exuding</b> sweat from every pore.",

It was the <b>expedient</b> way to contribute in class so she could get credit for being part of the discussion, but not risk expressing her own ideas and having them criticized or misunderstood."
