            "Confucius was born into a noble but <b>impoverished</b> family in 551 BCE in what is now the province of Shantung. His father died when he was three; as a young man he worked as a herder and storekeeper in order to support himself and his widowed mother. Unable to pay for a formal education, he became a <b>voracious</b> reader whose wide and lively learning soon earned him a formidable reputation as a scholar.",
            "Hired as a tutor to the sons of the wealthy, he decided to open his own school. Willingness to learn was the only requirement; lack of money was no <b>impediment</b>. Because Confucius required the wealthier parents to pay for the education of the poorer students, many of his students went on to hold important government offices, thereby adding to his reputation as a man of learning and moral character. Almost all who knew Confucius extolled his virtues.",
            "An exception to these admirers was Lao-tzu, a man whose writings are second only to those of Confucius in their impact on China. The two sages met when Confucius was in his early thirties. Lao-tzu was more than fifty years his senior. Confucius was deeply impressed by the older man's wisdom, but Lao-tzu, <b>venerated</b> as the founder of the religion of Taoism, thought the younger man <b>callow</b>. This judgment is not surprising, for Lao-tzu’s concerns were spiritual, while Confucius’ thoughts were focused largely on <b>secular</b> matters. For example, Confucius declined to discuss whether the soul survives the death of the body. His position was that because one cannot understand the meaning of life, there is no point in <b>speculating</b> about the mystery of death.",
            "Confucius’s concern had always been with such practical questions as how to achieve good government and how best to conduct relations within the family and between individuals. His answer to both questions was 'li'—translated as 'good manners.' That meant those in authority should show respect to those beneath them. Confucius’ ideas were particularly appropriate for his time because during that period, China lacked a strong central government. <b>Despotic</b> warlords ruled China, and their constant <b>strife</b> and widespread vice brought disorder and misery to the common people. In the words of one of Confucius’ <b>contemporaries</b>: 'The world had fallen into decay, and right principles had disappeared.' As a result of his success with former pupils, Confucius was made a minister of justice in his native province of Lu. Not surprisingly, he proved to be a <b>sagacious</b> administrator. As high officer, Confucius was able to practice and encourage others to do the same. In this way, he helped restore order in the land, all but eliminated crime, and gave the people of Lu a period of peace.",
            "This happy state was short-lived. The ruler of Lu Province grew <b>indolent</b> and began taking advice from those who wanted to return to the old ways. They wanted more opportunity for personal enrichment. Confucius found his influence <b>waning</b> in the corrupting government of Lu. After four years in office, he was dismissed as a result of the maneuvers of jealous rivals. Now fifty-six, Confucius spent the next thirteen years traveling throughout China, hoping to find a ruler who would accept his guidance. Although he failed in this endeavor, there is no evidence that he ever became <b>cynical</b>. Although Confucius did not put his principles into writing, groups of his followers passed on his teachings. These dealt with codes of conduct based on the belief that strong moral character is the basis of civilization and that inner goodness is reflected in outer behavior. Some three thousand principles of Confucius survive and became the basis of Chinese education for over two thousand years."
