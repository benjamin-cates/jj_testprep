            "Sadaf liked watching spy movies with her mother, particularly the James Bond films. Both of them laughed at the way the villains in these films <b>comported</b> themselves. They acted like <b>marauding</b> pirates in one scene, completely out of control and thirsty for money and power, and then turned around in the next scene and behaved in a much more <b>patrician</b> manner, delicately sipping from a cup of tea. The contrast was often hilarious.",
            "One afternoon Sadaf watched a marathon of James Bond movies with her mom, and they both noticed something equally amusing. Many of the villains seemed to share a predilection for keeping hungry sharks in tanks at their headquarters. They supposedly served a very <b>utilitarian</b> purpose: to kill the villain’s enemies.",
            "“They’re very expensive pets,” Sadaf’s mother said, giggling. “Imagine spending all that money on special shark food and equipment in hopes that your enemy would fall into your private tank and be eaten.”",
            "This got Sadaf thinking about all the various <b>fauna</b> in James Bond films. No matter what exotic location, there was always a threatening animal to be dealt with by the hero—scorpions, a giant squid, crocodiles, alligators, etc. How much did it cost the film companies to take care of and use these animals?"
