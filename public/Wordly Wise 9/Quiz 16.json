Pilar and her classmates in Honors Biology had been looking forward to the visit for six months, when it was suddenly canceled. It wasn’t often that an award-winning scientist of such high <b>caliber</b> made it all the way out to the rural area where she lived. In fact, Pilar had never met a working biologist at all and really wanted to ask her some questions.",
            "Pilar’s biology teacher, Ms. Assad, had arranged the visit through a <b>tenuous</b> connection—Ms. Assad’s second cousin had worked in the same research laboratory. Pilar was disappointed but didn’t lose hope. Her teacher was a big <b>exponent</b> of connecting young women to leaders in the science, math, and technology fields. She knew Ms. Assad would find another biologist willing to trek out to the middle of nowhere to talk to her class. It was just a matter of time."
