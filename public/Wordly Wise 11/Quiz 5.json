              "Parents of toddlers often have a difficult time doing basic tasks such as grocery shopping because their children are still learning how to behave in public. Toddlers are known for their <b>histrionic</b> temper tantrums and other <b>improprieties</b> that cause people around them to cringe or complain—particularly people who don’t have children of their own and don’t remember what it was like to be a child. That is why you see many parents <b>inveigling</b> their toddlers into being quiet with the promise of a treat or giving them a toy to play with as they shop.",
              "It may help for parents to be as <b>explicit</b> as possible about the rules for their child. For example, just before going to a grocery store, a parent might explain: “We use only quiet voices in this store.” However, toddlers are not old enough to fully understand the <b>repercussions</b> of their actions. Their sense of right and wrong is still very limited, and when they are tired and cranky, after being told “no” a lot, they tend to ignore rules."
