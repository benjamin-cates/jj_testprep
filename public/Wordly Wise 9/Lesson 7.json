            "When Anita Pollitzer received a batch of charcoal drawings done by an artist friend in South Carolina, an accompanying note told her not to show them to anyone. The work was of value to the artist, but she felt the drawings had little objective merit, and she could not bear the thought of their being <b>belittled</b> by strangers. Pollitzer disagreed with her friend's assessment, so, disregarding the <b>injunction</b> to keep the drawings to herself, she showed them to Alfred Stieglitz, the owner of “291,” a Manhattan art gallery. The usually <b>voluble</b> Stieglitz was silent as he studied the drawings intently. Their abstract shapes, suggestive of forms in nature, were unlike anything he had seen before. Finally he looked up. “What woman did these?” he asked, for he knew instinctively that they had not been drawn by a man. Pollitzer told him they were the work of her friend Georgia O’Keeffe. “I think I will give this woman a show,” Stieglitz replied.",
            "At the time of this <b>fateful</b> conversation in 1916, O’Keeffe was an unknown art teacher in her late twenties, while the fifty-two-year-old Stieglitz had an international reputation as a photographer and art dealer. It was almost entirely due to his efforts that photography had become recognized as one of the fine arts. Camera Work, his <b>sumptuously</b> printed magazine, first appeared in 1903, and his gallery at 291 Fifth Avenue, which opened two years later, sold photographic prints as works of art. An admirer of the painters Picasso and Matisse long before their work was fashionable, Stieglitz introduced these giants of modern art to the American public.",
            "Stieglitz went ahead with his plan to give “this woman” a show without <b>divulging</b> his intention to O’Keeffe. She found out about it by accident on a visit to New York and stalked into the gallery, demanding that the drawings be taken down. Stieglitz calmly ignored her <b>expostulations</b> and told her she had no right to withhold her work from the world. The force of his conviction may have made O’Keeffe feel like an <b>ingrate</b>, for she withdrew her objection.",
            "In the months that followed, O’Keeffe, who had moved to Texas where she was giving art lessons, was constantly in Stieglitz’s thoughts. His letters to her were filled with passionate expressions of concern for her future as an artist, but his words grew increasingly <b>amorous</b> as his outpourings received a ready response. Letters passed between them at a furious rate, sometimes as many as five a day. “They knock me down,” O’Keeffe wrote to Anita Pollitzer, “but I get up again.”",
            "Stieglitz was waiting to welcome O’Keeffe when she returned to New York in May 1917. The two wanted to marry, but there was one snag. Stieglitz already had a wife. The marriage was <b>moribund</b>, and Stieglitz intended to get a divorce. This did not save them from the <b>censure</b> of many family members and friends who disapproved of the relationship. Stieglitz’s wife came from a wealthy family, and he had used some of her money to <b>subsidize</b> his artistic ventures. These funds were cut off, and Stieglitz was reduced to accepting handouts from his brothers to survive. Camera Work ceased publication, and his gallery closed.",
            "The lean years ended in 1921 with a triumphant exhibition of Stieglitz’s photographs; O’Keeffe had posed for forty-five of them, and they created a sensation. O’Keeffe became an instant celebrity, and Stieglitz was able to command the <b>exorbitant</b> sum of five thousand dollars for a single photograph of her. Two years later he arranged an exhibition of one hundred O’Keeffe paintings and drawings. Twenty sold immediately, and O’Keeffe’s career was launched. The next year, following his divorce, she and Stieglitz were married.",
            "The marriage, which ended with Stieglitz’s death in 1946, was marked by long separations as O’Keeffe was drawn increasingly to the American Southwest, the inspiration for much of her art. Sun-bleached skulls in desert landscapes and oversized flowers in extreme close-up are the most common <b>motifs</b> in her paintings. She outlived her husband by more than forty years, and when she died, at ninety-eight, her paintings sold for millions of dollars. Today they hang in museums and private collections throughout the United States. Her reputation continues to grow, and today she is <b>deemed</b> by most critics the greater artist of the two."
