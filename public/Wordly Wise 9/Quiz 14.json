He and the other members played some warm-up games, in which each person <b>articulated</b> his or her reasons for joining. One new girl said she wanted to star in a Broadway musical someday. No one laughed; instead, they all encouraged her to sing a song, and she did. She was amazing!",
            "That made Hiro brave enough to tell everyone he acted out <b>parodies</b> of his favorite reality TV shows and uploaded them to the Internet. Before he knew it, he was acting out his favorite TV chef’s <b>dextrous</b> and theatrical handling of pots and pans, mimicking his <b>obtrusive</b> personality, yelling at people and lunging around an imaginary kitchen. By the time the meeting ended, Hiro had made two new friends, and lots of people had told him they’d subscribe to his video channel. He was so glad he’d joined the club!"
