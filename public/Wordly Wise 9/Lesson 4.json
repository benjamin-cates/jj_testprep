            "An old <b>adage</b> states that the longest journey begins with a single step. If the journey is along the length of the 2,144-mile Appalachian National Scenic Trail, that step will be followed by approximately five million more! The trail stretches primarily along the crest of the Appalachian Mountains from Springer Mountain, Georgia, to Mount Katahdin, Maine. Known as 'the longest footpath in the world,' it <b>meanders</b> through fourteen states along the Atlantic seaboard. Virtually all the land over which the trail passes is owned by the National Park Service. The trail itself, however, is privately managed by thirty-one Appalachian Trail Clubs. These clubs, whose members are all volunteers, are <b>punctilious</b> about maintaining the trail and its markers; they also provide the <b>Spartan</b> shelters located a day's hike apart along its length.",
            "Several million people walk a part of the Appalachian Trail each year. A hundred or so travel its entire length. It takes them up to half a year to do so. These 'thru-hikers' include people from all walks of life. They range in age from teenagers to people in their seventies and older. A retired admiral, a couple on a six-month honeymoon walk, and a veteran hiker who has traveled the trail half a dozen times may find themselves bedding down in the same shelter at the end of the day to <b>recuperate</b> from six or eight hours of strenuous walking. As the sun goes down, hikers enjoy the <b>camaraderie</b> that develops among those enjoying a common experience. They can rub their sore feet, share the food they carry in their backpacks, and <b>regale</b> each other with stories of the day’s adventures.",
            "Perhaps the most remarkable 'thru-hiker' is Bill Irwin. Irwin’s eight-month adventure began when he set off from Springer Mountain in the early spring of 1990. It ended when he reached Mount Katahdin on November 22. Because his trip took longer than most, he had to <b>contend</b> with ghastly weather conditions toward the end. Such conditions included one-hundred-mile-per-hour wind gusts and a blizzard that dumped two feet of snow on the trail. The reason his hike was so long and slow is that Irwin is a blind person. He was accompanied only by Orient, his service dog. In a wry allusion, Irwin referred to himself and his companion as 'the Orient Express'.",
            "The trail’s true allure is one of its main attractions. Although Irwin was unable to enjoy the splendid mountain views it affords, other senses are so highly developed that through listening, feeling, and smelling, he believes he missed very little. He couldn’t read the white two-by-six-inch markers painted on trees and rocks beside the trail; but he was never in danger of getting lost. To Orient, whose sense of smell is unusually well developed, it was easy to follow the <b>odoriferous</b> trail—filled with the smell of foliage, earth, and other hikers and their belongings.",
            "What is it that draws people to the Appalachian Trail? Some seek the challenge of exchanging a <b>sedentary</b> lifestyle for one that tests their strengh and will to the limit. For such people, success can be exhilarating. Carrying a fifty-pound backpack crammed with hiking <b>paraphernalia</b> while trudging with wet, bilistered feet up a steep hill in a heavy downpour might not seem like fun. Those who have done it, however, say that to dwell on such times is to miss the point. Satisfaction comes from coping with whatever nature brings",
            "Other hikers set out to escape the <b>hubbub</b> of the city for a few days, weeks, or months of solitude in the wilderness. As they ignore minor physical discomforts, they say that they can escape <b>temporal</b> concerns and reflect upon what is essential and what is <b>extraneous</b> in their lives.",
            "Most set out from Springer Mountain and head north, but regardless of the direction hikers travel, many say that the inner journey they experience is the most important one."
