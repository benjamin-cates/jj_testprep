            "A diamond is the hardest substance found on Earth. It can be scratched only by another diamond and is <b>impervious</b> to even the strongest acids. A diamond is so dense that light passing through it slows to one-third its normal speed.",
            "A diamond is a mineral form of carbon. For carbon to crystallize as a diamond, extreme heat and great pressure are required. Diamonds are likely formed in molten rock deep in the earth and then forced upward. In its natural state, a diamond can have one of several appearances, including that of a lusterless opaque gray or black stone or even a <b>nondescript</b> bit of glass.",
            "What transforms a diamond from its natural state into the <b>scintillating</b> gem in the jeweler's display case? It depends largely on the diamond cutter's skill in cutting, cleaving, and polishing it. In the past, after <b>scrutinizing</b> the deamond from every angle, the cutter would <b>cleave</b> it with a single blow aimed at a precise spot, a nerve-wracking experience because the stone could shatter if struck at the wrong angle. Today, most diamonds are cut with lasers that are actually thin, metal disks. Polishing, the final step in diamond cutting, requires a revolving iron wheel to create <b>facets</b>—the flat surfaces that reflect light, making the diamond sparkle. Though diamond cutting may reduce the size of the original stone by as much as fifty percent, the end result is a brilliant diamond with special <b>allure</b> and value.",
            "Valued since <b>antiquity</b>, diamonds originally were thought to come only from India. But in the 1700s they were discovered in Brazil; in the 1800s, South Africa became a major source. Now diamonds can be found in other parts of Africa, Australia, and the United States as well.",
            "The heaviest rough, or uncut, diamond on record was discovered in South Africa in 1905. Weighing 3,106 carats, or slightly over one and one-third pounds, it was cut into nine fashioned gems. Its owner must have <b>reposed</b> great trust in the cutter, who reportedly studied the stone, the Cullinan, was cut into nine large and ninety-six smaller gems. The largest of these, the Star of Africa, weighing 530.2 carats, is presented by the South African government of Transvaal to the king of Great Britain. It is the second largest cut diamond in the world and is kept under tight security in the Tower of London, where it forms part of the British crown jewels.",
            "There was great excitement in the diamond world in the early 1980s when an 890-carat rough diamond was found in South Africa in the early 1980s. In its owners hoped to cut it into flawless final gems. To help determine its final shape, diamond cutters made several plastic <b>facsimiles</b> cut in various ways. As the cutters proceeded, they realized the truth of the gem cutters' old saying: The diamond, not the diamond cutter, tells the saw where to \"go.\" For the owners found themselves in a <b>quandary</b>: Either their diamond would be the largest in the world but would not be perfect, or it could be perfect but not the largest in the world. It finally became the world's largest diamond at over 545 carats. It has been <b>appraised</b> at more than four hundred million dollars.",
            "Beginning in the 1950s, attempts had been made to create <b>synthetic</b> diamonds. The problem at the time was that real diamonds are formed far below the Earth's surface. There was no way to duplicate those conditions in the laboratory. Then, in the 1950s, scientists succeeded in producing pressures of one and a half million pounds per square inch, and, as a result, they were able to <b>transmute</b> graphite (a form of carbon) into industrial-quality diamonds. These are said to be strong cutting diamonds and are useful in various kinds of drills. Today, even greater pressure produces artificial gemstones of gem-like quality with weights up to one carat. One such imitation diamond is made from the mineral zircon that when exposed to high temperatures, loses its color and takes on a great brilliance.",
            "A fine-quality diamond can cost as much as fifty thousand dollars a carat. But size is only part of the story. A diamond's value depends on what jewelers call the four Cs: cut, clarity, carat, and color. White diamonds are highly regarded, whereas stones with a yellow or tan tinge are not. Green and blue diamonds are very rare, and the extremely rare pink diamond will sell for as much as a million dollars a carat! Unfortunately, for the average buyer, diamonds <b>depreciate</b> substantially in value as soon as they are purchased."
