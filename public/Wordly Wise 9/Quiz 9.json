They imagine that the people living in the houses are all the same, too. It might be easy to make such an assumption from the outside. They can’t see beyond the sameness of the houses to realize that the individuals inside are different and distinctive.",

Over time, as they make connections with friends and family within those communities, they become <b>impervious</b> to the judgment from outsiders. They know they don’t have to make a choice between <b>reposing</b> in a quiet suburban backyard and having <b>scintillating</b> conversations with fascinating people—they can have both. A good conversation can happen anywhere!"
